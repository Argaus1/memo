> Major module: Infrastructure Setup with ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
for Log Management.
In this major module, the objective is to establish a robust infrastructure for log
management and analysis using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
Key features and goals include:
◦ Deploy Elasticsearch to efficiently store and index log data, making it easily
searchable and accessible.
◦ Configure Logstash to collect, process, and transform log data from various
sources and send it to Elasticsearch.
◦ Set up Kibana for visualizing log data, creating dashboards, and generating
insights from log events.
◦ Define data retention and archiving policies to manage the storage of log data
effectively.
◦ Implement security measures to protect log data and access to the ELK stack
components.
This major module aims to establish a powerful log management and analysis sys-
tem using the ELK stack, enabling effective troubleshooting, monitoring, and in-
sights into the system’s operation and performance.
